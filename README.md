# Kosovar Sign Language
This project uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and TensorFlow to recognize Albanian Sign Language (ASL) letters and gestures in real-time from webcam input. The system captures hand, face, and body landmarks, trains an LSTM model on keypoints, and predicts gestures with live video visualization.

...Still a work in progress
